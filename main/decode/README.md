## Instructions
run this cammand before you do anything else:
```
mkdir data
```
#
Here you put directly your audio files (only files in .wav format, no any other files or folder) into the folder ```data/``` then you can run the following commands:
```
cd .. #if your are in the folder main/decode, you do not need to do it if your are already in main/
```
and then 
```
./decode.sh
```

Please make sure that you will be in the ```main/``` to run the script but NOT in this folder (```main/decode```)
